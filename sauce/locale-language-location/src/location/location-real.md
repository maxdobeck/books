# Location: Real
Just like the [Intro](../intro/lll.md#app-requirements) mentions, you'll need to know how geolocation is consumed and then used. If your app listens for changes on the location API for the device's Operating System then any testing should be straightforward. For example in Google Maps or Apple Maps you can set the Geo Location with Appium and see the change reflected in real time on the default Map app.
