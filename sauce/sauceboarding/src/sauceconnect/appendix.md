**Automation** - No human involvement necessary. Sauce Connect starts, gracefully retries, and gracefully shuts down. Usage of Sauce Connect is completely abstracted away to the point that end users aren't aware of its existence.

**CICD** - Continuous Integration/Continuos Delivery. Make a change -> trigger automated building, linting, compiling, static analysis, etc etc etc. A automated process GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab, Azure DevOps or Pipelines, and additional vendors for operations like building artifacts. 

**Manual** - Human involvement _required_. Stopping, starting, and usage of the tunnel is at least in part tied to a person sitting down in real time behind a workstation.
