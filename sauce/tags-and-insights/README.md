# Leveraging Sauce Labs Through Metadata 
Sauce Labs exists as a platform, and for many users is a website they only frequent to debug. The typical draw is assets like Screenshots, Videos, or logs. However this is only the tip of the iceberg, Sauce Labs offers the ability to categorize and groups tests by whatever paradigm you or your company use.

If you run Builds or Specs and would like each instance of these grouped visually and logically in Sauce Labs you can do it!

Then all users can consume the Ã¼ber grouping in the <https://app.saucelabs.com> UI or via our [REST API](https://docs.saucelabs.com/dev/api/) or [Webhooks](https://docs.saucelabs.com/basics/integrations/webhooks/).
